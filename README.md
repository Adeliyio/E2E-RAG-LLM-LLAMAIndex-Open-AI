# Retrieval LLM Generation APP

### Business Case:
Our organization aims to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance information retrieval and knowledge management processes. To achieve this, we have developed a robust query engine using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology for effective data mining and information retrieval.

#### Project Overview:
The project focuses on implementing a query engine that utilizes CRISP-DM principles to enhance machine learning-based information retrieval. The engine is designed to efficiently retrieve relevant information from a corpus of documents based on user queries.

#### CRISP-DM Phases:

#### Business Understanding:

- Understanding the business objectives: Our goal is to improve information retrieval by implementing a robust query engine.
- Assessing the current challenges: Existing information retrieval systems lack efficiency and accuracy.

#### Data Understanding:

- Data collection: The corpus of documents is collected and stored in a structured format.
- Data exploration: Understanding the characteristics of the data and its relevance to user queries.

#### Data Preparation:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from the documents to improve retrieval accuracy.

#### Modeling:

- Implementing the query engine: Developing the engine based on CRISP-DM principles for efficient information retrieval.
- Model training: Training the engine to understand user queries and retrieve relevant documents.

#### Evaluation:

- Assessing model performance: Evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of the query engine.
- Gathering feedback: Soliciting feedback from users to improve the system.

#### Deployment:

- Deploying the query engine: Integrating the engine into existing information retrieval systems.
- Providing user support: Ensuring users are trained to effectively use the new system.

#### Implementation Details:

The implementation is based on Python programming language using the llama_index library.
The query engine utilizes the VectorStoreIndex and SimpleDirectoryReader modules for document indexing and retrieval.

The CRISP-DM methodology is applied in each phase of the project to ensure effectiveness and efficiency.
The system is designed to persistently store indexed documents using the StorageContext module to facilitate quick retrieval and minimize computational overhead.
